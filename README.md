# Sniper

A Manifest V3 extension to perform dynamic user specified actions on a web page without `userScripts` permission (And thus w/o need for developer mode).

## How

By using [Computed property names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#computed_property_names).  
The provided selector string is directly passed onto `document.querySelector` and the provided `action` and `arguments` are then applied to each element as `elem[action](...args)` or as values to HTML Element properties as `elem[action] = args`
